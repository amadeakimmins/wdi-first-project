# Colour Match

### Project 1 - GA WDI LONDON

This game is inspired by the effect found in Psychology, called the Stroop effect. It demonstrates that our reaction time is severely reduced when the name of a colour (e.g. 'orange', 'blue', or 'purple') is printed in a different colour. For example , if the word 'RED' is printed in a orange colour then you click the 'ORANGE' button NOT the red button. The time taken to name the colour of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the colour of the ink matches the name of the colour.

This is a one player game that has 6 levels all testing the players reaction time and ability to click the correct colour of the word shown and not the name of the word.
